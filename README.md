# Domestication and Improvement Reshaped the Genomic Architecture of Abiotic Stress Tolerance in Sunflower

In this study, we leverage publicly available genomic resources that span wild, landrace, and modern cultivated sunflower accessions to perform a comprehensive population genomic analysis. 
Through these analyses, we identify historically balanced loci that are preliminarily associated with abiotic stress responses, including putative salt-tolerance sites. 
Within these regions, we also observe an enrichment of deleterious variants, suggesting that some beneficial ancestral alleles may have been lost or that unfavorable alleles may have been retained during modern improvement. 
Together, these results underscore the need for targeted breeding efforts to restore historically advantageous alleles related to salt tolerance. 
By providing a clearer picture of salt‐related genetic variation and its evolutionary history, this study offers valuable guidance for developing more resilient sunflower cultivars.
